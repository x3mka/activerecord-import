# activerecord-import

activerecord-import is a library for bulk inserting data using ActiveRecord. 

### Rails 3.1.x and higher

Use the latest activerecord-import.

### Rails 3.0.x up to, but not including 3.1

Use activerecord-import 0.2.11. As of activerecord-import 0.3.0 we are relying on functionality that was introduced in Rails 3.1. Since Rails 3.0.x is no longer a supported version of Rails we have decided to drop support as well.
